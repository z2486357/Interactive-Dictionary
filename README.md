# Interactive-Dictionary

This application is like a dictionary.
User enter a word and print out the meaning of the word.
If the input of the user is not in the database, there will be two condition.
1. If the word is close to the word in the database "XXX", the program will ask if you mean "XXX" ? If yes, the program will show the meaning of the "XXX". If no, the program will show the word does not exist. If you didn't choose yes or no, the program will say you enter a meaningless input and show the meaning of "XXX"
2. If the word is not close enough to any word in the database, then the program will show the word does not exist

The program did not have a user interface yet, maybe I will add it in the future.
